# Dog training

Training is essential for a well-behaved, happy dog. This guide covers basic commands, house training, and behavioral guidance.

## Basic training principles

### Positive reinforcement

The most effective training method uses rewards rather than punishment:

- **Treats**: Small, high-value food rewards
- **Praise**: Enthusiastic verbal encouragement
- **Play**: Games and toys as rewards
- **Timing**: Reward immediately after the desired behavior

<Tip>
Keep training sessions short (5-10 minutes) and end on a positive note to maintain your dog's enthusiasm.
</Tip>

### Consistency is key

- Use the same commands every time
- Ensure all family members use identical training methods
- Practice regularly, even after your dog has learned the command
- Be patient - learning takes time

## Essential commands

### Sit

1. Hold a treat close to your dog's nose
2. Slowly move your hand up, allowing their head to follow the treat
3. As their head moves up, their bottom should naturally touch the ground
4. Once sitting, say "Sit" and give the treat
5. Practice 5-10 times daily

### Stay

1. Start with your dog in the "sit" position
2. Hold your hand up in a "stop" gesture
3. Take one small step back
4. If they stay, immediately return and reward
5. Gradually increase distance and duration

### Come

<Warning>
Only practice "come" in a secure, fenced area until your dog reliably responds to this command.
</Warning>

1. Start in a small, enclosed space
2. Get down to your dog's level and say "Come" enthusiastically
3. Reward generously when they come to you
4. Never call your dog to come for something they perceive as negative

### Down

1. Start with your dog in the "sit" position
2. Hold a treat in your closed fist near their nose
3. Slowly move your hand down to the floor
4. Pull your hand along the ground away from them
5. When they lie down, say "Down" and reward

## House training

### Crate training

Benefits of crate training:
- Provides a safe, comfortable space
- Aids in house training
- Prevents destructive behavior when unsupervised
- Useful for travel

**Crate training steps:**

1. **Introduction**: Make the crate comfortable with bedding and toys
2. **Feeding**: Feed meals in the crate with the door open
3. **Short periods**: Gradually increase time spent in the crate
4. **Overnight**: Once comfortable, use for overnight sleeping

### House training schedule

| Age | Bathroom breaks needed |
|-----|----------------------|
| 8-10 weeks | Every 30-60 minutes |
| 10-16 weeks | Every 2-3 hours |
| 16+ weeks | Every 4-6 hours |

**House training tips:**
- Take your dog out immediately after eating, drinking, playing, or waking up
- Choose a specific outdoor spot for bathroom breaks
- Reward immediately after they eliminate outside
- Never punish accidents - simply clean thoroughly and continue training

## Behavioral issues

### Common problems and solutions

**Excessive barking:**
- Identify triggers (doorbell, other dogs, boredom)
- Redirect attention with commands or activities
- Provide adequate exercise and mental stimulation
- Consider professional training for persistent issues

**Jumping on people:**
- Turn away and ignore the behavior
- Ask visitors to do the same
- Reward calm greetings
- Practice "sit" before greeting people

**Pulling on leash:**
- Stop walking when the leash becomes tight
- Only move forward when the leash is loose
- Reward walking beside you
- Consider a front-clip harness for better control

## Advanced training

### Mental stimulation activities

Dogs need mental exercise as much as physical exercise:

- **Puzzle toys**: Challenge your dog to work for treats
- **Hide and seek**: Hide treats around the house
- **Training new tricks**: Keep their mind engaged
- **Agility**: Set up simple obstacle courses

### Professional training

Consider professional help for:
- Aggressive behaviors
- Severe anxiety or fear issues
- Complex behavioral problems
- Competition training
- Service dog training

## Training schedules

### Puppy training timeline

**8-16 weeks:**
- Basic commands (sit, stay, come)
- House training
- Socialization
- Crate training

**16+ weeks:**
- Reinforce basic commands
- Leash training
- Advanced commands (down, heel)
- Address behavioral issues

### Adult dog training

Adult dogs can learn at any age! Focus on:
- Establishing routines
- Building trust and bonding
- Addressing specific behavioral concerns
- Reinforcing positive behaviors
