| Managing | Classroom management actions (announcements, directions, encouragement) |
| Questioning | Content and non-content questions, rhetorical questions |
| Relaying | Answering questions, explaining answers, providing hints |
| Communicative approach | Interactive/non-interactive, authoritative/dialogical |
| Task phases | Introduction, during task, closing task |

### Tech stack
