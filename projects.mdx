### Most recent change

The most recent update refactored the projects section in `projects.js`, reorganizing how projects are displayed on the site.

## Chemistry research

The Instructor Facilitation Coding Scheme is a visualization tool for chemistry education research. The project is deployed at [facilitation-visualization.netlify.app](https://facilitation-visualization.netlify.app/).

### Key features

- **Excel file upload** - Upload research data in Excel format
- **Customizable visualization** - Configure width, seconds per check mark, and check mark intervals
- **Canvas rendering** - Uses Fabric.js for high-quality image generation
- **Export capability** - Double-click to save visualizations as images

### How it works

The tool helps researchers analyze instructor facilitation techniques by converting coded Excel data into visual representations. It supports multiple visualization modes including interactive, non-interactive, dialogical-interactive, and dialogical-nonInteractive schemes.

### Most recent change

The most recent update created the initial README.md file for the project, documenting the deployment URL.
