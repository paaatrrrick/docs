## Chemistry research project

The Instructor Facilitation Coding Scheme ([facilitation-visualization.netlify.app](https://facilitation-visualization.netlify.app/)) is a visualization tool for analyzing chemistry instructor communication techniques.

### Purpose

Renders graphical representations of data on instructors' communication techniques during classroom sessions.

### Features

- Upload Excel files containing coded facilitation data
- Generates timeline visualizations on an HTML canvas using Fabric.js
- Configurable width, seconds per check mark, and check mark intervals
- Supports multiple shape types (rectangles, circles, triangles, diamonds, hexagons) for different code categories

### Code categories

The tool visualizes various instructor behaviors:

- **Task phases**: Introduction, during task, closing task
- **Interaction types**: Instructor/student initiated, group/whole class interactions
- **Communicative approaches**: Interactive/non-interactive, authoritative/dialogical
- **Managing behaviors**: Announcements, calls on students, directions, encouragement
- **Questioning types**: Content questions, non-content questions, rhetorical questions
- **Relaying behaviors**: Answering questions, explaining answers, giving hints
