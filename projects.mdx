## Chemistry research visualization

The Instructor Facilitation Coding Scheme tool ([facilitation-visualization.netlify.app](https://facilitation-visualization.netlify.app/)) is a research visualization application for analyzing chemistry instructor communication techniques.

### Purpose

This tool helps researchers visualize data on instructor facilitation schemes by generating graphical representations from Excel files. It was developed as part of a research group investigating the efficacy of various chemistry teaching approaches.

### Features

- Upload Excel files containing coded instructor behavior data
- Generate visual timelines of instructor activities
- Configurable output width, time intervals, and check mark frequency
- Export visualizations as images

### Visualization categories

The tool visualizes multiple categories of instructor behavior:

**Interaction types**
- Instructor-initiated group interaction
- Instructor-initiated whole class interruption  
- Student-initiated group interaction
- Student-initiated whole class interruption

**Communicative approaches**
- Interactive authoritative
- Noninteractive authoritative
- Interactive dialogical
- Noninteractive dialogical

**Managing activities**
- Call on student, classroom management, course reminders
- Giving directions, reading prompts, time information

**Questioning patterns**
- Content questions (answered/unanswered)
- Non-content questions
- Rhetorical questions
- Cold calls

**Relaying information**
- Answer assessment, explains answer, gives analogy
- Giving hints, provides task answer, responds to student answers

### Tech stack

- Vanilla JavaScript
- Fabric.js for canvas rendering
- read-excel-file for parsing Excel data
