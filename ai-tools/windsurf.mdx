Windsurf is Codeium's AI-powered IDE. This guide shows how to configure Windsurf for better results on technical writing tasks and using Mintlify components.

## Prerequisites

- Windsurf editor installed
- Access to your documentation repository

## Setup

1. Open Windsurf and navigate to your documentation repository.
2. (Optional) Add project rules to customize AI behavior for documentation tasks.

## Project rules

Create a `.windsurf/rules.md` file in your documentation repository root to define project-specific guidelines:

```markdown
# Mintlify documentation rules

## Writing standards
- Use second-person voice ("you")
- Use sentence case for headings
- Include prerequisites at the start of procedural content
- Add language tags to all code blocks

## Mintlify components
- Use Steps for sequential procedures
- Use Tabs for platform-specific content
- Use CodeGroup for multi-language examples
- Wrap images in Frame components

## Content guidelines
- Keep explanations concise and actionable
- Include code examples that users can copy and run
- Add alt text to all images
- Use relative paths for internal links
```

## Tips for documentation tasks

<Tip>
Use Windsurf's Cascade feature to make changes across multiple documentation files at once.
</Tip>

### Common prompts

- "Update all code examples to use the latest API version"
- "Add missing alt text to images in this file"
- "Convert this procedure to use Mintlify Steps component"
- "Check this page for consistency with our style guide"
