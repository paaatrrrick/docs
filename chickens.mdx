## Overview

Chickens are domesticated birds that belong to the Gallidae family. They are the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a global population exceeding 25 billion. Chickens are primarily raised for their meat and eggs.

## Physical characteristics

Chickens display varied physical traits depending on breed:

- Two legs with four toes each (three forward, one back)
- Feathers in various colors and patterns
- Wings capable of short flights despite being flightless
- Sharp beaks for pecking and foraging

## Breeds and varieties

### Egg-laying breeds
- **Leghorn**: White eggs, excellent layers producing 280+ eggs annually
- **Rhode Island Red**: Brown eggs, hardy dual-purpose breed
- **Sussex**: Good layers with calm temperament
- **Australorp**: Black feathers, excellent egg production

### Meat breeds
- **Cornish Cross**: Fast-growing, ready for processing in 6-8 weeks
- **Jersey Giant**: Largest chicken breed, slow-growing
- **Freedom Rangers**: Slower-growing, better for free-range

### Ornamental breeds
- **Silkie**: Fluffy, silk-like feathers
- **Polish**: Distinctive feather crest on head

## Behavior and social structure

Chickens exhibit complex social behaviors:

### Pecking order
- Hierarchical social structure within flocks
- Dominant birds have priority access to food and nesting sites
- Established through pecking and posturing

### Communication
- Over 30 distinct vocalizations
- Different calls for warnings, food discovery, and social interaction
- Body language including wing positioning and head movements

### Foraging behavior
- Natural instinct to scratch and peck for food
- Prefer insects, seeds, and vegetation
- Dust bathing for parasite control and comfort

## Egg production

### Laying cycle
- Hens begin laying at 18-24 weeks of age
- Peak production occurs in first year
- Average laying hen produces 250-300 eggs annually
- Eggs develop over 24-26 hours

### Egg anatomy
- **Shell**: Calcium carbonate protective outer layer
- **Albumen**: Protein-rich egg white
- **Yolk**: Nutrient-dense center containing vitamins and fats
- **Membranes**: Inner and outer protective layers

## Housing and management

### Coop requirements
- 4 square feet per bird in coop
- 10 square feet per bird in outdoor run
- Nesting boxes (one per 4-5 hens)
- Roosting bars 18-24 inches off ground
- Proper ventilation and protection from predators

### Feeding
- Commercial layer feed with 16-18% protein
- Fresh water access at all times
- Grit for digestion
- Calcium supplements for shell production
- Kitchen scraps and treats in moderation

## Health considerations

### Common health issues
- **Parasites**: Internal worms and external mites
- **Respiratory problems**: Often caused by poor ventilation
- **Egg binding**: Difficulty passing eggs
- **Bumblefoot**: Bacterial infection in feet

### Prevention
- Regular coop cleaning and maintenance
- Proper nutrition and clean water
- Quarantine new birds
- Regular health checks and veterinary care

## Economic importance

### Global impact
- Provides affordable protein worldwide
- Supports rural livelihoods and food security
- Major agricultural industry worth billions
- Accessible livestock for small-scale farmers

### Products
- **Eggs**: Primary protein source in many diets
- **Meat**: Chicken is the most consumed meat globally
- **Feathers**: Used in pillows, clothing, and crafts
- **Manure**: Excellent fertilizer for gardens

## Lifecycle

- **Incubation**: 21 days from egg to hatching
- **Chicks**: Require heat and starter feed for 6-8 weeks
- **Pullets**: Young hens before first egg
- **Adult**: Productive laying period of 2-3 years
- **Lifespan**: 5-10 years depending on breed and care
