## Chemistry research

The [Instructor Facilitation Coding Scheme](https://facilitation-visualization.netlify.app/) visualization tool was created to support research on chemistry teacher communication approaches.

### What it does

- Converts Excel data from classroom observations into visual timelines
- Displays instructor facilitation codes as shapes on a configurable timeline
- Supports multiple interaction types and communicative approaches

### How to use it

1. Upload an Excel file containing coded classroom observation data
2. Configure width, seconds per check mark, and check interval
3. Double-click the generated image and save

### Visualization codes

The tool renders different shapes and colors for various instructor behaviors:

| Category | Example codes |
|----------|---------------|
| Managing | Call on student, classroom management, giving directions |
| Questioning | Content questions, rhetorical questions, cold calls |
| Relaying | Answer assessment, explains answer, provides task answer |
| Interaction types | Instructor/student initiated, group/whole class |
