<Info>
  **Prerequisites**:
  - Node.js version 19 or higher
  - Git repository with documentation files
  - Basic knowledge of command line operations
</Info>

This guide walks you through setting up a local development environment for your Mintlify documentation site.

## Quick setup

<Steps>
<Step title="Install Mintlify CLI">

Install the Mintlify CLI globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g mint
```

</Step>

<Step title="Clone your repository">

Clone your documentation repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-docs-repo.git
cd your-docs-repo
```

</Step>

<Step title="Start the development server">

Navigate to your docs directory and start the local server:

```bash
mint dev
```

Your documentation will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Development workflow

### Making changes

1. Edit your MDX files in your preferred text editor
2. Changes are automatically reflected in the browser
3. The development server supports hot reloading for instant feedback

### Working with images

Place images in the `/images` directory and reference them in your MDX files:

```markdown
![Alt text](/images/your-image.png)
```

### Testing navigation

Your navigation structure is defined in `docs.json`. After making changes:

1. Restart the development server
2. Verify all links work correctly
3. Check that new pages appear in the navigation

## Development server options

### Custom port

Run on a different port using the `--port` flag:

```bash
mint dev --port 8080
```

### Environment variables

Set development-specific variables in a `.env.local` file:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

## Validating your documentation

### Check for broken links

Validate all internal and external links:

```bash
mint broken-links
```

### Preview production build

Test how your docs will appear in production:

```bash
mint build
mint preview
```

## File watching and hot reload

The development server automatically watches for changes in:

- MDX files
- Configuration files (`docs.json`, `mint.json`)
- Image assets
- Custom CSS files

Changes trigger an automatic browser refresh.

## Working with components

### Built-in components

Mintlify provides several built-in components you can use:

```mdx
<Info>
Information callout
</Info>

<Warning>
Warning message
</Warning>

<Steps>
<Step title="Step title">
Step content
</Step>
</Steps>
```

### Custom components

Create custom React components in a `/components` directory and import them in your MDX files.

## Debugging common issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Port already in use">
    If port 3000 is occupied, Mintlify automatically tries the next available port. You'll see a message like:
    
    ```
    Port 3000 is already in use. Trying 3001 instead.
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Changes not reflecting">
    1. Check that you saved your files
    2. Ensure you're editing the correct file path
    3. Try refreshing the browser manually
    4. Restart the development server if needed
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Images not loading">
    1. Verify images are in the `/images` directory
    2. Check the file path in your MDX file
    3. Ensure image file names don't contain spaces or special characters
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best practices

### File organization

```
your-docs/
├── docs.json          # Main configuration
├── index.mdx          # Homepage
├── guides/           # Guide pages
├── api-reference/    # API documentation  
├── images/           # Static assets
└── components/       # Custom components
```

### Version control

- Commit changes frequently during development
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Create feature branches for major documentation updates
- Test locally before pushing to main branch

### Performance tips

- Optimize images before adding them
- Use relative links for internal navigation
- Keep MDX files focused and well-organized
- Test on different devices and screen sizes
