### Design considerations

### Healthy treats and supplements

Safe treats include:
- Leafy greens (lettuce, spinach, kale)
- Vegetables (carrots, squash, broccoli)
- Fruits in moderation (berries, melons)
- Scratch grains as occasional treats

## Health and care

### Daily care routine

1. **Morning**: Let chickens out, check food and water
2. **Evening**: Collect eggs, secure coop for night

- Production decreases in winter and during molting

### Collection best practices

- Collect eggs at least once daily
- Use clean containers
- Store eggs pointed end down
- Refrigerate promptly for best quality

## Troubleshooting common problems

### Low egg production

Possible causes:

Solutions:
- Ensure adequate space and resources
- Remove or isolate bullying birds
