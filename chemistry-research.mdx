title: Instructor facilitation coding scheme
description: A visualization tool for analyzing instructor communication techniques in chemistry education
---

The [Instructor Facilitation Coding Scheme](https://facilitation-visualization.netlify.app/) is a web-based tool that transforms Excel data into visual representations of instructor facilitation patterns.

## Purpose

This tool helps chemistry education researchers:

- Visualize instructor communication techniques over time
- Analyze patterns in classroom facilitation
- Generate high-resolution images for publications and presentations

## How it works

1. Upload an Excel file containing coded instructor facilitation data
2. Configure visualization parameters (width, time intervals, check mark frequency)
3. Double-click the generated image to save it

## Configuration options

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Width | 4000px | Output image width |
| Seconds per check mark | 60 | Time interval between tick marks |
| Check marks until labeled | 10 | Interval between labeled time markers |

## Coding categories

The tool visualizes several categories of instructor behavior:

### Task phases

- **Introduction of task** - Blue bordered rectangles
- **During task** - Green bordered rectangles  
- **Closing task** - Orange bordered rectangles

### Communication approaches

- Interactive authoritative
- Noninteractive authoritative
- Interactive dialogical
- Noninteractive dialogical

### Instructor actions

- **Managing** - Squares representing classroom management activities (announcements, directions, encouragement)
- **Questioning** - Triangles representing different question types (content, non-content, rhetorical)
- **Relaying** - Circles representing information delivery (answering questions, explaining, giving hints)

### Interaction types

- Instructor-initiated group interaction
- Instructor-initiated whole class interruption
- Student-initiated group interaction
- Student-initiated whole class interruption

## Tech stack

- Vanilla JavaScript
- [Fabric.js](http://fabricjs.com/) for canvas rendering
- [read-excel-file](https://www.npmjs.com/package/read-excel-file) for Excel parsing
