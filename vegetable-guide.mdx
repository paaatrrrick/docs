### Root vegetables

These underground vegetables store energy as starch and provide sustained nutrition.

- **Carrots**: Rich in beta-carotene for eye health
- **Sweet potatoes**: High in vitamin A and fiber
- **Beets**: Contains nitrates for cardiovascular health
- **Radishes**: Low calorie with vitamin C

### Cruciferous vegetables

Members of the cabbage family containing sulfur compounds with cancer-fighting properties.

- **Broccoli**: High in vitamin C and sulforaphane
- **Cauliflower**: Versatile and rich in choline
- **Brussels sprouts**: Packed with vitamin K and folate
- **Cabbage**: Anti-inflammatory with vitamin C

### Nightshades

- Zucchini and summer squash

**Cool, dry storage**:
- Potatoes and sweet potatoes
- Onions and garlic
- Winter squash

**Counter ripening**:
- Tomatoes (until ripe)
- Avocados

## Cooking techniques

### Preparation methods

Different cooking methods affect nutrient retention and flavor:

**Raw consumption**:
- Maximizes heat-sensitive vitamins
- Maintains crisp texture
- Best for salads and snacks

**Steaming**:
- Preserves water-soluble vitamins
- Maintains color and texture
- Quick cooking method

**Roasting**:
- Concentrates flavors through caramelization
- Creates appealing textures
- Good for root vegetables

**Sautéing**:

## Meal integration

### Daily incorporation

Strategies for increasing vegetable intake:

- Fill half your plate with vegetables at meals
- Start meals with vegetable-based soups or salads

- Add vegetables to smoothies for extra nutrition
- Use vegetables as pasta alternatives (zucchini noodles)

### Flavor enhancement

Make vegetables more appealing:

**Seasoning options**:
- Herbs: basil, thyme, oregano, cilantro
- Spices: garlic powder, paprika, cumin
- Acids: lemon juice, vinegar, lime

**Healthy fats**:
- Olive oil for roasting
- Avocado oil for high-heat cooking
- Nuts and seeds for texture

## Seasonal eating

### Spring vegetables

- Asparagus: High in folate and vitamin K
- Peas: Sweet and rich in protein
- Artichokes: Contains cynarin for liver health

### Summer vegetables

- Zucchini: Mild flavor, very versatile

## Common questions

### Are frozen vegetables nutritious?

Yes, frozen vegetables are often more nutritious than fresh because they're frozen at peak ripeness, preserving nutrients.

### How do I reduce bitterness in vegetables?

Try blanching briefly, adding a pinch of salt, or pairing with sweet ingredients like caramelized onions.

### Can I eat vegetables raw?

Most vegetables can be eaten raw, but some like potatoes, eggplant, and kidney beans require cooking for safety and digestibility.

## Next steps

Now that you understand vegetable basics:

- Plan meals around seasonal vegetables
- Experiment with new cooking methods
- Try one new vegetable each week
- Grow your own herbs and easy vegetables
- Combine vegetables with complementary flavors

Remember, variety and consistent consumption are key to maximizing the health benefits vegetables provide.
